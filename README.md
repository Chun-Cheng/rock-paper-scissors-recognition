# rock-paper-scissors-recognition

This repo uses the [Rock Paper Scissors SXSW: Hand Gesture Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/rock-paper-scissors?resource=download) dataset.

## Method 1

To train the model, run [train_rps_model.ipynb](train_rps_model.ipynb).

To use the model to predict the rock-paper-scissors from an image, run [predict_rps_model.ipynb](predict_rps_model.ipynb).

## Method 2

To train the model, run [train_yolov11_rps.ipynb](train_yolov11_rps.ipynb).

To use the model to predict the rock-paper-scissors from an image, run [detect_yolov11_rps.ipynb](detect_yolov11_rps.ipynb).
