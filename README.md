This repo uses the [Rock Paper Scissors SXSW: Hand Gesture Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/rock-paper-scissors?resource=download) dataset.

To train the model, run [train_rps_model.ipynb](train_rps_model.ipynb).

To use the model to predict the rock-paper-scissors from an image, run [predict_rps_model.ipynb](predict_rps_model.ipynb).
